## Overview
Hi there!

We hope that the process is going well for you so far.

The task is designed to test your full-stack experience, problem-solving skills and attention to detail. 


## Instructions
- The code consists of a minimal project using Next.js and chakra-ui
- Clone the code to your local development environment
- Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies and `yarn run dev` to start the dev server
- You are allowed to use any documentation online
- Complete as many steps as you can in the given timeframe
- Refer to [this Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/d9c7lPbEoFoyKlgqHUTdrz/FE-Assignment?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=wNFQaDiLoPAMV6mP-1) when implementing the below steps

## Steps
1. Build a Python API server using FastAPI / Flask / Django / any other framework you prefer.
   - The server should expose the `/integrations` API endpoint
   - The API endpoint should return the list of integrations, including the following information for each one:
     - Name
     - Description
     - Logo
2. Add a new page called "Library" under the authenticated section, and add it to the sidebar (under INTEGRATIONS). 
3. Add a grid to the page, and include cards with an “integration” icon in the middle. Load the integrations list from the API server you just created.
